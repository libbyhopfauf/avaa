As with analog dropout, DV dropout in source signals results from a loss of information recorded or read from the tape by the VTR playback heads. It might be due to tape wrinkling, creasing or other tape damage, manufacturing defects, environmental dirt, or transport shock during recording. Dropout appears as pixels of missing data in the image, which may be substituted with video information from nearby frames during playback. Severe and consistent dropout may indicate clogged heads in a playback machine or significant damage/deterioration to the source media.

## Can it be fixed?
Maybe. If the tape is damaged and that video information is missing, then you cannot recover the image.

If it was an error on part of the deck, then you might be able to reduce the dropout by cleaning the deck and/or tape. This is a good way to determine if the dropout is the result of a headclog or damage to tape/deck. Try cleaning your deck and transferring the tape again. If the artifact is still in the same spot, the tape is damaged and that video information is missing.

<sub>Dropout artifacts are sprinkled across the image. This resulted from the information being lost and DV error consealment copying video blocks from the proceeding frame.</sub>

<sub>This dropout looked a lot like a headclog, but deck/media cleaning and multiple retransfers across a variety of decks resulted in the same image, meaning the information was lost.</sub>
