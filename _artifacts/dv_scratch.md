## Definition
As with analog tape scratches, DV scratches results from the tape being damaged by an outside source (either within the camcorder, deck, person or debris) causing a horizontal ridge along the tape, making it difficult for the deck to read and removing information from the tape. 

A scratch can be identified by either opening the cassette door and checking for damage or jagged vertical lines (similar to dropout) that travel fluidly along the playback image.

## Can it be fixed?
No, the damage cannot be reversed.
